    This data privacy statement informs you about the purpose, type, and scope
    of the data collected by the CoCov app. The application comprises the CoCov
    app (hereinafter referred to as "app") and the backend server of the
    Institute of Medical Systems Biology at Ulm University. Here, the analysis
    takes place. This means that the data transmitted is not only processed by
    the app, but also by the backend server.
</p>
<p>
    We take the protection of your personal data very seriously and work in
    full compliance with the applicable data protection regulations. The
    following paragraphs will inform you about this:
</p>
<p>
    (1) the purpose for which the data are collected
</p>
<p>
    (2) what is the legal basis for the processing,
</p>
<p>
    (3) how long we keep the data and where they are stored,
</p>
<p>
    (4) which personal data are collected via the CoCov app,
</p>
<p>
    (5) why age, sex, vaccine, and vaccination date are recorded and stored
</p>
<p>
    (6) that no data is passed on to third parties,
</p>
<p>
    (7) what rights you have as a user and how you can exercise them.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. Purpose of data collection and processing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Proving data about occurred adverse events after vaccination with one of
    the new corona-vaccines helps the University Hospital of Ulm to gain an
    overview of possible symptoms. Moreover, this offers the possibility to
    detect previously unknown and rarely occurring symptoms. Findings from the
    study are to be made available to the public in an anonymous form. For this
    purpose, your data will be evaluated together with the data of all other
    app users (hereinafter "purpose").
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        It is emphasized explicitly that the app does not provide medical
        advice or individual diagnostics.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. Consent to data processing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The processing of data is carried out based on your consent to the
    processing of special categories of personal data (health data) in addition
    to the purpose mentioned above (art. 6 para. 1 lit. a and art. 9 para. 2
    lit. a DSGVO).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        3. Scope of the data collected, storage location, and duration
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    3.1 We process the personal data of the users mentioned in section 4 for
    the intended purpose and following the statutory provisions. For the
    above-mentioned purpose, your age, sex, vaccine, and time of vaccination
    are recorded. The data transfer of collected symptoms takes place via a
    pseudonym automatically generated by the app. Please note, that a data
    transfer is only possible if you agreed previously to the data transfer.
</p>
<p>
    3.2 Which data are stored for the purpose is stated in section 4. At any
    time, the University Hospital Ulm stores directly identifying information
    such as name or address. Only the data mentioned in section 4 is stored.
</p>
<p>
    3.3 The automatically generated pseudonym displayed in the app enables you
    to exercise your data subject rights. Please handle it carefully and keep
    it protected from access by third parties. If you lose your pseudonym, you
    will no longer have the opportunity to request the deletion of your data.
</p>
<p>
    3.4 By agreeing to take part in the study and entering symptoms after
    vaccination with one of the new corona vaccines, you are sending your data
    and permitting the data mentioned under 4.2 to be stored and processed for
    the above-mentioned purpose.
</p>
<p>
    3.5 The retrieval of the data logged by you takes place between your
    smartphone and the server of the Institute of Medical Systems Biology at
    Ulm University. This data is transmitted in encrypted form to the server
    operated by us exclusively in Germany, where it is processed, and the data
    mentioned in section 4.2 is stored.
</p>
<p>
    3.6 Your data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the data collection
    and processing mentioned in section 1 ceases to apply, At the latest, your
    data will be deleted after 10 years. Until then, your data will be stored
    in a pseudonymised form on a server of the Institute of Medical Systems
    Biology at Ulm University. In accordance with Guideline 17 of the
    "Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice" of the German
    Research Foundation (as of September 2019), data will be stored for up to
    10 years. Only the evaluation results will be published for research
    purposes in an aggregated and anonymised form. This does not allow any
    conclusions to be drawn about your person. Moreover, this aggregated and
    anonymised data may be stored permanently in a scientific research
    database.
</p>
<p>
    3.7 If you no longer wish to use the app, you can delete it. If you also
    wish to delete the data you have already transferred to us, you can do this
    before deleting the app under the menu item "Delete my data". Data that has
    already been included and published in evaluations at this point cannot be
    removed retroactively, as it has only been included in the evaluations in
    anonymised form. However, data that has not yet been evaluated in
    anonymised form will not be used for future evaluations and will be
    deleted. Due to technical circumstances, the complete deletion of data can
    take up to 30 days. The stated deletion period of 30 days refers to data
    storage in backups. In the active system, the data is deleted within a
    maximum of 24 hours, usually much faster.
</p>
