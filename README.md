CoCoV App for tracking adverse events after COVID vaccination

The CoCoV app was developed to track adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination. The app comprises a questionary with common adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination. After completion, the data (without personal information) is sent to a secure server (configurable). File transfer is secured via the https-protocol. Furthermore, the user can access a summary to the occurred adverse events via the app. This summary and a diary overview, which collects all the answered questionnaires aims to increase patient-empowerment and patient-doctor communication. In case of serious adverse event, the patient can show these lists to the attending doctor to allow for better and more efficient treatment.
Moreover,  the data from the CoCoV app aims to study the most common/serious adverse events occurring after COVID-19 vaccination.
